							<h1>Brandon Wang</h1>
							<blockquote>
								I am currently a 4th year at the University of Texas at Austin studying Applied Learning and Development and planning to graduate
								Fall 2023.
								Previously, I was a student at the Univeristy of Texas at Dallas studying Computer Science,
								where I am also a 4th year by credit hours. Although I love all aspects of teaching, my interest in programming led me to pursue further 
								education through online courses and obtain certifications in various areas of software engineering, such as full-stack development and machine 
								learning. My passion and drive to learn in regards to programming has now led me to pursue a career 
								as a Software Engineer.

									<h2>RPEasy</h2>
									<p>
										RPEasy is an IOS app designed to help fitness enthusiasts track the intensity and quality of their workouts in real time. 
										Built with SwiftUI for WatchOS, RPEasy takes heart 
										rate data from an Apple Watch and uses an algorithm to calculate a user's Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) on a scale of 1-10. 
										The RPE is displayed as a number at the 
										top of the screen, while a real-time graph of the workout set is displayed below.
										<br>
										I created RPEasy as a passion project after hitting a plateau in my own fitness journey and needed additonal
										data to track the quality and intensity of my workouts. In creating the RPE calculation algorithm, I used my knowledge as a
										certified personal trainer as well as feedback from members of the Longhorn Powerlifting Team to calculate as accurate 
										an RPE as possible

									<h2>SentiSummary: Sentiment Analysis on YouTube Video Summaries </h2>
									<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, my classes relied heavily on YouTube videos for remote learning, 
										which often required lengthy annotations. In response, I created a Chrome extension using Flask 
										and the YouTube transcript API to simplify the process by providing a transcript of the videos.
										 However, I took it a step further and implemented Hugging Face's AI 
										 summarization pipeline based on the distilbart-cnn-12-6 model to streamline the transcript. As I took a government 
										 class that involved watching a lot of news channels, I decided to add rudimentary sentiment 
										 analysis using the TextBlob API and its NLP capabilities. This allowed me to gain insights into the emotions 
										 conveyed by news channels, providing me with a deeper understanding of the content presented.

									<h2>Location Optimizer</h2>
									<p>During my senior year, my friends and I planned a weekend trip to New York City. 
										While planning, I found comparing the prices and distances of potential hotels to be an extremely tedious 
										task. To tackle this challenge, I utilized my backend development skills and integrated Google API to build 
										a program that takes in the trip itinerary and outputs a list of optimal hotels. The program divides a rough 
										circle around the locations into cells and checks for available hotels. Based on the travel time and price, the 
										hotel information is then sorted and returned as a list to help users easily make an informed decision. <br> <br>
								To my dismay, friends completely disregarded the optimized suggestions and chose Feather Factory which is both expensive 
								and an hour away from anything in our itenerary.</p>

									<h2>Pocket Partner</h2>
									<p>
										Pocket Partner is a chatbot that utilizes the OpenAI API to provide fitness-related information to users. 
										To optimize its responses with relevant and accurate information, I fine-tuned the Davinci model with my 
										experience working with clients and their questions. <br>
										While working as a personal trainer, I noticed that 
										many of my clients lacked knowledge about their body structures, experience levels, and time commitments, and 
										that generic search results didn't always cater to their specific needs. I created 
										Pocket Partner to make information more easily accessible and encourage safe exercise practices.
